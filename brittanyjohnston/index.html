    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    That girl currently staring you down in the funny glasses through the computer screen is me. 
    Currently, I am a junior graphic design major at Massart. I try to incorporate alot of my 
    hand-drawn skill sets into my work whenever possible but also maintain a high standard for 
    creating simple and clean designs. Iâ€™m also never afraid to run with my odd ways of thinking 
    if I think I might be headed somewhere exciting!
